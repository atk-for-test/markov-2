This is an implementation of a new way to do higher-order Markov chains. Where conventionally a Markov chain would use a matrix with one row for each n-gram of the input, this uses a tree.

As far as I can tell, this would use less memory than a matrix, might improve probability searching capabilities, but might also slightly slow down the search (as it will have to traverse the tree instead of just looking up the particular cell in a matrix).
